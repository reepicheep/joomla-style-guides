<h2>Style Guides of Joomla! PHP and Supportive Technologies</h2>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>"You need to write code that minimizes the time it would take someone else to understand it - even if that someone else is you."</strong>

<p>The purpose of this collection is draw the attention to relevant sources of styles guides for the software within the Joomla! ecosystem. It may be used as a basis for development of individual styles of designers/developers, companies and organizations.
</p>
<p>The role of code standards in Joomla! cannot be underestimated. An important aspect is writing code for the future and Rafael Dohms has strongly emphasized the role of <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/slideshow/embed_code/15471808#" target="_blank" title="'Object Calisthenics and Code Readability' by Rafael Dohms">"Object Calisthenics and Code Readability"</a>.
</p>
<p>At the level of Joomla! Production Leadership Team there is a commitment to make the Joomla! CMS fulfill its code style standards. 
</p>
<p><a href="http://www.joomla.org/about-joomla/the-project/leadership-team.html" target="_blank" title="Javier Gomez of the Joomla! Production Leadership Team">Javier Gomez</a> righfully thinks that standardization is important for many reasons, some of which are:
<ul>
	<li>Programmers can go into any code and figure out what's going on;</li>
	<li>New people can get up to speed quickly;</li>
	<li>People new to PHP are spared the need to develop a personal style and defend it to the death;</li>
	<li>People new to PHP are spared making the same mistakes over and over again;</li>
	<li>People make fewer mistakes in consistent environments;</li>
	<li>Automated tools can check the code.</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>I will start with the Joomla! styles guides, continue with native PHP and some of the Joomla! supportive technologies: JavaScript, CSS and HTML.
</p>
<p>More supportive technologies, especially libraries, together with front-end style guides, will be added in later updates.
</p>
<p>The list is open for discussion and improvements.
